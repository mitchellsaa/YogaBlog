			<h1> Yoga</h1>

			<p>Yoga is the action of being. Being in the now. Being in the present moment. Being one with each breath you take. To be in the now is to be timeless. To be in the events of yesterday is to be trapped in time. To be with that which your mind perpetuates is to be robbed of your bliss splitting your attention. Yoga is BEING in your totality, equaling that which is everything. Yoga means union in its most basic sense. Union with that which is beyond time and space but the pure state of consciousness. </p>
