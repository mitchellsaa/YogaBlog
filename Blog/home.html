			<h1> What is SuperConsciousness?</h1>

			<p>It is the oldest, wisest, most pure form of consciousness as a human being you can ever represent. It is also called Spirit, or knower, seer, witness, that is one, with consciousness. </p>

	<div class="mainlink">
			<h1> How do I attain it?
				-through Yoga</h1>

			<p>Yoga is the action of being. Being in the now. Not yesterday, not whatever imaginary feeling or thought comes up to your mind. It is BEING in your totality, equaling that which is everything. Yoga means union in its most basic sense. </p>

	<div class="secondmainlink">
			<h1> How else do I attain it? <br> &#45;through your breath </h1>

			<p>Your first breath in this lifetime is the ongoing process of evolution within your being. Breathing means living. You are conscious, aware, full of intentions, and being. Your breath is the language of the mind.  </p>

	</div>
	
	<div class="thirdmainlink">
			<h1> The most certain way to SuperConsciousness: Meditation </h1>

			<p>Go within. Every thought, emotion, and every other distraction in the like, can be foreseen in the mind, conceived there, like a wave in the ocean. Exploring your being from within is the biggest step toward BEING, here, right now. </p>
